This will target slightly more quads. For a low bar squat, shift the bar down two or three inches. This will target slightly more glutes and low back. Second, an efficient walkout. Don't take too many steps. That's just wasted energy. Instead, take one step to clear the rack, a second step to match the other foot, and a third adjustment step if you need to get them even. Third, stance width. Narrow and wide stances both work, but for most people just outside shoulder width with slightly flared toes is best. Fourth, depth. Try to break parallel for the best gains, but cutting depth a bit shy won't kill your gains. For powerlifting, you do need to get your hip crease below your knee joint for the lift to count. Squat shoes and ankle mobility drills, dropping the weight back can help you get deeper. Fifth, a good bar path. Ideally, the bar should travel in a straight line centered over the middle of your foot. If it shifts a bit, that's okay. Try to keep it in balance the best you can. Now you have my"

For the next 365 days, we're both doing a challenge to see who can pack on more muscle. I'm starting at 165 pounds and 15% body fat. Brad's also 165 pounds, but he's 36% body fat. Oh, it hurts so much. We're lifting five days a week, every last set to failure. No exceptions. Brad is doing awesome. I'm noticing that my social anxiety is almost gone, and that was debilitating at times. But I put on 11 pounds of fat during our bulk. So we started our cut to get back to our starting weight. And after one year, I put on 2.7 pounds of lean mass. Not bad for someone with 15 years of training. But Brad, he put on 10 pounds of lean mass. And his body fat dropped from 36 to 29%. And he's still going. This is what he looks like now, showing off the family genes."

      "transcription": " Here are my top three quad exercises of all time. In third place, the Bulgarian split squat. These are super effective for quad growth and probably would be my number one pick, if not for how brutally fatiguing they are. Because they're so draining, I only do two sets per workout. In second place, the leg extension. Turns out, leg extensions are actually much better for growing the big rectus femoris head of the quads than squats. That's most likely because your hips are fixed on a leg extension, which allows the multi-joint rectus femoris head to actually stretch and squeeze. You could actually argue that the leg extension is the best quad exercise since it hits all four heads better than squats. But since some leg extension machines don't allow you to get quite as deep as I like, I'm leaving it in second place. My number one quad builder beats out the leg extension mainly because of its enormous capacity for progressive overload. And in the real world, it just seems to lead to the best results. It's the squat. You can squat any way you like. Barbell, Smith machine, hack squat, they'll all blow up your quads."

This gets my knees nice and warm for squats, and I usually pick seated over lying leg curls because this study showed they cause about 1.5 times more muscle growth. Next, I do Smith machine squats for the quads and glutes. Here, I get as deep as I can and explode out of the hole. Doing these on the Smith allows me to push my last set to failure without worrying about dumping the bar. After that, it's the Romanian deadlift for the glutes and hamstrings. Here I focus on pushing my hips back without allowing my lower back to round. Using straps on these is smart, your glutes and hands should be stronger than your grip. Then I do leg extensions for the quads. Here I set the seat back to get a deep stretch in the rectus femoris. On my last set I do mile reps beyond failure. Basically rest for a few seconds, crank another three reps, and repeat. Then I superset two sets of hip adductions for the inner thighs with two sets of hip abductions for the glutes, and then four sets of standing calf raises."

I bet a lot of my audience would say the science guy. That's because he's tapped into the new and optimized methods. But I bet a lot of the bodybuilding community would say the bro will build more muscle because he trains harder. Let's break it down. The science guy would know from a pile of research that you need to get really close to failure to maximize muscle growth. If he isn't training really hard, he's not really science-based. And the bro will have figured out that doing a variety of different exercises to target the muscle from different angles is a good idea. And the science guy could provide a study to support that. Assuming they both stay natural, I do think the science guy would build more muscle and be less likely to get injured over the long term. But they'll both make gains, and the practical difference between them probably isn't as big as it seems."

And today I'm speaking at Harvard Med about why having bigger biceps could save your life. You see, your muscles not only stretch and contract, they also act like a sponge, pulling sugar out of your blood. This keeps your blood sugar stable, which lowers your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even some types of cancer. And people with more muscle don't just live longer, they also live better. Lifting weight stimulates your brain too. This sharpens your memory, your focus, and lowers your risk of dementia. It also strengthens your bones, which reduces your risk of fracture. That could be the difference between walking and a wheelchair. But here's the best part. It doesn't take much. Even just two full-body workouts a week can help you stay strong to keep doing the things that give your life meaning. So keep lifting. Your future self will thank you."

Let's say you're walking around and you see somebody wearing a cool shirt. All you have to do is point your camera at the shirt and Apple will use their AI layer to find out the brand and give you the link. Now imagine that across every use case. Your car engine light is on. You point the camera and Apple tells you how to figure it out. All of a sudden your phone becomes this super smart visual assistant. Eventually, it might be able to look at a poster on the street and redesign yours or analyze an injury and help diagnose what to do. All visually, just by pointing your iPhone camera. And to me, this was the big takeaway of the event. All of the coolest stuff was about making the camera smarter and easier to use. This new camera button, crazy video features, cool photo recipes. I was kind of wondering what Apple is going to do to keep people upgrading. But it's the visual AI that's going to make these phones so much more powerful than every other model. And their strategy, of course, is super smart. Make the AI layer free, but make it so powerful that only the latest phones are advanced enough to run it. It's super clear that the future of mobile computing is going to be visually based. Show the computer something and let it react. And that's either going to come from smart glasses you wear or a camera you hold. So it looks to me like Apple just made their first AI chess move."

You can now upload a single photo of yourself and try on billions of clothes instantly. But here's the crazy part. These aren't just shirts or dresses photoshopped on your body. Google built an AI fashion model that actually understands how different fabrics stretch and drape across your specific body. So it looks way more accurate than it possibly could before. Now, the implications of this are pretty insane. Everyone in the world is going to have a custom digital mannequin that actually looks like them. Height, size, depth, everything. And when you combine this with Google Shopping's 50 billion products and their world-class recommendations, you can literally go from chat to virtual try-on in seconds. But as mind-blowing as that is, here's where I think all this goes. In just a couple years, Google will allow anyone to create their own personal shopping avatar that will show up on any fashion site on the internet. So instead of guessing if the Lululemon model's fit is going to work for you, you'll become the model instantly on any site you want. And this means less returns, less waste, and 100x better shopping experience. In essence, the entire internet is going to become one giant digital fitting room, all personalized for you.

This is WorldCoin, the wildest social human money experiment ever created. WorldCoin started with a simple vision. What if there was one global financial network owned by everybody on Earth? Unhackable, no corruption, sounds pretty great. But here's where it gets a little dicey for me. In order to make that kind of system, every person needs one unique ID. Think of it like a login that can't be stolen or hacked. And the team decided the best way to do this was to scan your iris, the colored part of your eye. Because other options like face ID, palm scan, or even email could be hacked or manipulated by AI. So you look into this silver orb and it verifies that you're uniquely you and a human. They call it proof of personhood. In exchange, you're officially verified on the network. And they give you some tokens, currently worth about 50 bucks. Call it a sign-up bonus. Now the idea is, if they're able to grow this network with enough proven humans, businesses will start to build for it. You know, like we take MasterCard, Visa, Apple Pay, Eyes. In the best case, it could become the new financial rails, like what crypto originally promised, but without the scams. But here's the craziest part where it starts to get a little spooky for me. The co-founder of WorldCoin is Sam Altman. And you might know that name. He's also the co-founder of OpenAI, which made ChatGPT and basically kick-started this whole AI revolution.

Uber lets you call a car. FaceTime lets you call a friend. GPTs are the next generation of apps, but with AI superpowers. Here's a Canva GPT that lets you design posters just by chatting with them. You don't need to know how to use Canva or even design principles. You just need to know how to type into a computer. Now, the craziest example I saw was using Zapier to connect 6,000 apps together. Gmail, Slack, Calendar, everything that you use every single day. So GPTs become your one command center for everything. There'll be no need to even open other websites. But here's the craziest part of all. OpeningEye designed GPTs so they can be built without needing to code. All you have to do is have a chat conversation with the builder and you'll have a new GPT in minutes. Now, if you've been playing with ChatGPT for a while, you'll know that OpenAI already launched plugins. Well, think of GPTs like the next generation of plugins, but way easier to build and improve without needing code. It's going to open up the ability for customizing AI to everyone. Now, OpenAI is planning to launch their GPT app store soon, and it's going to offer a revenue share to the people that build the most popular GPTs. It's going to be a huge money-making opportunity for early adopters. I think this is the moment where AI applications get extremely useful extremely quickly. I'd pay attention to this."

It's already done $100 million in ticket sales. For reference, that's the sixth highest of any movie this year in the same category as Spider-Man and Barbie. But it's not the ticket sales that's making Hollywood mad. It's the split. Because in a savage business move, she completely cut them out. A normal movie looks something like this. There's four main parties. The movie producers, the Hollywood studios, AMC, and the local theaters. Now, typically, the movie producer will sell the film rights to a Hollywood studio because the studios control the relationship with AMC and have the money to fund the marketing to get eyes on the trailers. You don't use the studio, your movie's not getting seen. Now, all four parties get a cut of the profit, but guess who gets the majority? The studios. They take up to 70% of the income from the opening weekend. But Taylor said, hold on a minute, why do we need a Hollywood studio? I can pay for the filming myself and I have a massive audience. With one Instagram post, I can get tens of millions of people to know about this movie. So she cut them out. She made a deal directly with AMC. All three groups made more money and Hollywood got nothing. Now, believe it or not, Hollywood isn't that mad about Taylor's movie specifically. I'm sure they would have loved to have made $70 million with zero effort, but their problem is much bigger than that. What they're really mad about is that she broke into the vault and shared the secret recipe for how to beat them. Now, any group of actors with an audience has a playbook for going direct.
